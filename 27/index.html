            <p class="card-text">A project coordinator with management experience of support agency of EU project
            in the field of school education. After 9 years experience in the field of online education I’m looking
            for new challenge in IT. The successful completion of DevNetSkills bootcamp by the Open University and
            coding bootcamp by Laba academy demonstrates my capability to quickly acquire new skills. My analytical
            and problem solving thinking, communication skills, ability to work in a team helped me to raise the number
            of teacher participants to 3000 on the project portal and later support this network of users during 9
            years. I’m currently seeking a new challenge that will utilize my previous skills in online education
            and new coding skills.</p>
